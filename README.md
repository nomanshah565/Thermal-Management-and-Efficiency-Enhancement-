Thermal management and efficiency enhancement of photovoltaic module using PCM based finned heat sink
This work focused on the issue of heating of PV module with the increase of temperature and in the result decrease in its efficiency. The aims and objectives are,
Development of Fins & PCM based heat sink at the back of PV modules.
Data collection for different days.
Comparison of the results of the modified PV module with reference one.
Analysis of the suitability of the proposed fins and PCM based PV module cooling system.
